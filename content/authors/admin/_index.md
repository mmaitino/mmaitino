I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. I graduated in International Relations at the same university. My research interests include foreign policy analysis, global environmental politics, bureaucratic politcs, and decision making processes.
My dissertation project is focused on the patterns of Brazilian participation in multilateral environmental conferences, explaining its variation over time and its implications for policy.
